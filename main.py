"""
Implement a program that : 
- Prompts the user for input (random music key / string of keys). Can be on a random string or all at once (Menu)
- List of naturals and accidentals OR one list for naturals, one for sharps, one for flats
- Accidentals are all there, even the same ones, but don't follow themselves (e.g. : G# and Ab, which are the
same, don't follow themselves)
- Maybe one natural and one accidental for the list, with changing order
