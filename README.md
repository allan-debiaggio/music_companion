# Music Companion
***
Program that generates a random music key or string of keys. Can be on a random string or all at once.

- Menu where you choose between the list and a random key , or a random key on a random string.
(List needs to be implemented first for my progress)
- There's a list of naturals and accidentals, or one for naturals, one for sharps, one for flats
- Accidentals are all there, even the same ones but don't follow themselves (e.g. : G# / Ab, which are
the same, don't follow each other)
- Maybe one natural and one accidental for the list, with changing order

## Goals : 
1.0 : Terminal Version  
2.0 : Pygame Version  
3.0 : More features (Maybe an included metronome), Multiple languages (dictionaries)
